# Plagueis
*"Did you ever hear the tragedy of Darth Plagueis The Wise?"*

Come one, Lorem Ipsum is outdated!

This package provides you with the famous sith legend of Darth Plaguies The Wise


## But I've never heard of it
I thought not. Itâ€™s not a story the Jedi would tell you.

## Is it possible to learn this power?
Not from an npm package

## Usage
You can use as a cli tool, maybe for copy-pasting purposes:
```
plagueis
```

Or you can import and use in your code:
```js
const plagueis = require('./index');
console.log(plagueis); //Did you ever hear...
```
