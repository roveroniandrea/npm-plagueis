# Plagueis
*"Did you ever hear the tragedy of Darth Plagueis The Wise?"*

Come one, Lorem Ipsum is outdated!

This package provides you with the famous sith legend of Darth Plaguies The Wise


## But I've never heard of it
I thought not. Itâ€™s not a story the Jedi would tell you.

## Is it possible to learn this power?
Not from an npm package

## Usage
You can use as a cli tool, maybe for copy-pasting purposes:
```
$ npm install -g plagueis
$ plagueis
```
It also supports different languages:
```
$ plagueis -en       #defaults to en
$ plagueis -it       #also --it and it works
```

Or you can import and use in your code:
```js
const plagueis = require('plagueis');
console.log(plagueis('it')); //Ti hanno mai raccontato...
```

## Contributing
You're welcome to contribute by adding more languages to the package! Just update [src/locals.json](https://github.com/roveroniandrea/npm-plagueis/blob/master/src/locals.json) and send a pull request.

*"These will make a fine addition to my collection"*
